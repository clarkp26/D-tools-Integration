API Key
API callers must add to each call a custom header named X-DTSI-ApiKey, along with the value of the API key.
For example, if the API key value is abcdefghijklmopqrstuvwxyz, the custom header would be as follows:

X-DTSI-ApiKey: abcdefghijklmopqrstuvwxyz

Process
- API call to get all projects.
- Parse and interpret from array of information which project you want details on.
- Use Project id to perform second API call for specific project you want details on.
- Parse and access the projects details from stored array.
